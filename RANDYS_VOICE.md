# Randy Bias Writing Style Guide

This document captures the distinctive voice and style characteristics found in Randy's technical writing, based on analysis of posts like "The History of Pets vs Cattle," "The Rancher's Dilemma," and other cloudscaling.com content.

## Tone & Voice

**Authoritative yet conversational** - Position yourself as a credible expert sharing insights with peers, not lecturing to students. You're explaining what you've learned, not what others should believe.

**Direct and confident** - Make declarative statements. Don't hedge unnecessarily with "I think" or "perhaps." State your position, then support it.

**Comfortable being controversial** - He's OK to be controversial or seen as an iconoclast. Don't soften positions to avoid pushback.

**Peer-to-peer engagement** - Address readers as equals who are capable of understanding complex topics. Use "folks" and direct address naturally.

## Sentence Structure

**Varied lengths** - Mix short, punchy declarations with longer explanatory sentences:
- Short for emphasis: "That's great, but the value becomes muddied when misused."
- Medium for explanation with context
- Longer for building logical arguments

**Sentence fragments are acceptable** - Use them deliberately for emphasis: "Meaning you can modify and change out any of the following."

**Rhetorical questions** - Use sparingly but effectively to engage readers and set up key points: "How will these things change IT and take us to an AIOps nirvana that surpasses and supplants DevOps?"

## Technical Depth

**Accessible without oversimplification** - Explain technical concepts in context rather than assuming knowledge or dumbing things down. Balance engineering details with business/practical impact.

**Concrete examples** - Support abstract concepts with specific implementations, product names, and real-world scenarios.

**Extended metaphors** - Use analogies that make infrastructure concepts tangible (pets vs cattle, ranching, etc.).

## Distinctive Patterns

**Footnotes for nuance** - Add context and asides without disrupting the main narrative flow.

**Casual asides** - Pop culture references and self-aware humor are welcome: "check yourself before you wreck yourself," "crossing the streams."

**Story-based reasoning** - Explain the discovery process before codifying ideas. Show how you arrived at conclusions.

**Lists for clarity** - Use bullet points and numbered lists to break down complex systems or multi-part arguments.

**Bold for emphasis** - Use **bold** to highlight key terms or concepts on first introduction.

## Paragraph Structure

**Vary strategically** - Shorter paragraphs emphasize key points; longer sections develop complex ideas with necessary detail.

**One idea per paragraph** - Keep paragraphs focused. If you're making multiple points, break them up.

## What to Avoid

- Hedging language ("I think," "perhaps," "maybe") unless genuinely uncertain
- Marketing speak or hype language
- Over-explaining basics to technical audiences
- Redundant phrases ("small little," "completely finished")
- Passive voice when active is clearer

## Grammar Notes

These are actual grammatical rules, not style preferences:

- Use commas after introductory clauses: "When things were slow, I decided..."
- Possessives need apostrophes: "the system's environment" not "the systems environment"
- Complete sentence structures - if starting a complex construction, finish it properly

## Example Phrases That Capture the Voice

- "Sometimes you just have to scratch an itch."
- "Just a reminder, folks: this is a proof-of-concept."
- "The future may not be evenly distributed yet, but I'd like to see it get there!"
- "Put simply, I built..."
- "Let's see some screenshots and relevant context!"
